traits-enaml
============

A library to facilitate interoperation of Traits with Enaml >= 0.8

Initially this repo should include wrappers for embedding TraitsUIs in Enaml UIs
and vice-versa.

This is where we might build a replacement for the type of functionality provided
by TraitsUI (eg. default UIs for HasTraits objects).
